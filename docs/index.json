How to search for folders on Steam Deck (Desktop Mode) Typical Save Game Folders / Paths on Steam Deck Copying files and folders to your PC or onto Steam Deck Trouble finding your save game folders and files for Windows games, Lutris and Heroic on Steam Deck? # Sometimes you want to backup your save games from Steam Deck to PC, or maybe transfer saves from PC to the Deck for games that don\u0026rsquo;t support cloud saves, or have been installed from one of the numerous third-party launchers, or manually via Lutris.\nWindows games often use the AppData folder for save game storage. Where would you find that location on Linux, SteamOS?\nHow to search for folders on Steam Deck (Desktop Mode) # If you know the name of the folder you\u0026rsquo;re looking for and have no clue where it might be located, a search might help you out. For instance, I was looking for the save path for Kingdom Two Crowns, knew that it would live inside %AppData% and the folder would be called /KingdomTwoCrowns/Release.\nYou could just search for that in Dolphin! Unfortunately my search process kept crashing, so I went with KFind (installed via Discover) and found my desired data.\nTypical Save Game Folders / Paths on Steam Deck # Often you are looking for a so-called Prefix Folder, Wine uses such folders to contain all of the configuration and windows bits and pieces needed for compatibility, like a registry.\nThey can live in various places across the file system, SteamOS also has a dedicated compatdata folder.\nFor reference, here are some paths you might want to check out if you\u0026rsquo;re searching for the equivalent path for %AppData% and similar. You\u0026rsquo;ll find that often the whole path structure (e.g. C:\\Program Files\\Blobotron) is mirrored in your file system on linux.\nTip: You can copy the paths from below and paste them into Dolphin\u0026rsquo;s Path bar by clicking on the breadcrumb navigation, then pasting.\nSteam compatdata folder (useful for games installed with steam)\n/home/deck/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/ Wine default prefix folder (useful for Lutris and similar)\n/home/deck/.wine/drive_c/users/deck/ Heroic default prefix folder\n/home/deck/Games/Heroic/Prefixes/ Copying files and folders to your PC or onto Steam Deck # To transfer files back and forth between your Desktop computer and Steam Deck, I can recommend using Warpinator.\nInstall the Windows client from e.g. this GitHub Releases Page (or another implementation) and get the Steam Deck client via the Discover store.\nWarpinator will allow you to drag and drop folders into the Application and accept the transfer on the other side, as long as both devices are on the same network\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to follow me on Twitter.

Option 1: Using the Dolphin GUI file manager Option 2: Using rsync Option 3: this guide, using dd to clone How to clone a whole drive in linux using the dd utility (e.g. for creating a perfect clone of your microSD on Steam Deck) Guide (start here): Clone your Steam Deck microSD in 3 easy steps! Step 1: Figure out the names of your devices (drives) in Konsole Step 2: Run the \u0026ldquo;dd\u0026rdquo; utility for a perfect 1:1 clone Step 3: Reboot and resize partition to fill drive Troubleshooting I bought a larger SD card for my Steam Deck - how to transfer everything without breaking apps / games? # You already installed a bunch of games to your microSD on Steam Deck, maybe EmuDeck or other emulation setup and a bunch of ROMs and perhaps games from itch.io, using the Heroic launcher and a whole bunch of other stuff to your 256 GB SD card.\nBut then you realise that SD cards are cheap. You buy a 512 GB A2 microSD or even a 1TB card.\nHow can you move / migrate your data from the old SD card to the new one?\nOption 1: Using the Dolphin GUI file manager # You can just copy and paste your respective folders using Dolphin (the Explorer equivalent of SteamOS) and that will work unless you have some weird setup - but that is painfully slow if your microSD is loaded with lots of data\u0026hellip; which is likely if you\u0026rsquo;re migrating to a larger disk.\nOption 2: Using rsync # I like command-line utilities and don\u0026rsquo;t quite trust GUI file managers for large data migrations. One kind reddit user suggested using rsync and provided a mini guide. I have found it to be too slow as well, in a quick test. If your disk is quite full or you have a lot of tiny files (likely!), use the guide below.\nOption 3: this guide, using dd to clone # This will max out the write speed of your microSD drive and provide the fastest result. It involves using the Terminal, but hey, you\u0026rsquo;re here to learn, right? This will teach you useful Linux-fu.\nHow to clone a whole drive in linux using the dd utility (e.g. for creating a perfect clone of your microSD on Steam Deck) # What you will need\nSteam Deck old microSD card new microSD card (equal in capacity, or larger) USB-C microSD card reader (or a USB-A card reader and a USB-C adaptor) alternatively: a USB-C dock featuring a SD Card Reader (that\u0026rsquo;s what I used) Handy to have, not required\nexternal Keyboard external Mouse Duration\nIt took me about 45 minutes to clone a 256 GB microSD to a new 512 GB drive I bought at a sale, then a few minutes for extra setup.\ncloning in progress Guide (start here): Clone your Steam Deck microSD in 3 easy steps! # Step 1: Figure out the names of your devices (drives) in Konsole # Using the Start Menu, launch Konsole (Terminal Emulator).\nNote: if you have not yet set your sudo password, now is the time to set that up. Simply enter the command passwd and hit return. Then configure your password of choice, this will be your superuser/root password for the future, we\u0026rsquo;ll need it in a sec.\nNow we need to determine which drive is which.\nRun the lsblk command to get an overview of your drives and partitions. Take note of the name based on the size of the device, that should help you identify it.\nExample:\nmy OLD microSD is called /mmcblk0 (in SD Slot) my NEW microSD is called /sdb (in card reader dock) Important! Your microSD devices might be called differently, so don\u0026rsquo;t just copy my example. Or you\u0026rsquo;ll have a bad time. Step 2: Run the \u0026ldquo;dd\u0026rdquo; utility for a perfect 1:1 clone # Now we can start cloning.\nImportant! Make sure you have your charger hooked up, as this will take a while! Enter the following command in Konsole:\nsudo dd if=/dev/$OLDCARDNAME of=/dev/$NEWCARDNAME status=progress bs=100M Important! replace $OLDCARDNAME and $NEWCARDNAME (no dollar sign!) with the respective names of the old and new cards. The order matters. What this does: This will clone the drive (and all partitions) specified in if to the drive specified in of, while displaying progress (nice!) and the bs=100M setting will help speed up the process to your microSD\u0026rsquo;s max write speed.\nIt might take a while, up to a couple hours if you\u0026rsquo;re cloning a large drive.\nWhen the process is complete, continue to the next step.\nmy microSD write speed is maxed out Step 3: Reboot and resize partition to fill drive # If you are migrating to a larger drive, we need to reboot for the linux kernel to report the correct size for the drive and free space available, so that we can resize the partition to the full extent of the drive. Otherwise it will retain the size of the old drive we cloned. Not useful!\nUsually Linux doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a lot of reboots, but this is one of the cases where you need to restart.\nSimply reboot from the power menu of SteamOS Desktop mode. After reboooting, the Steam Deck will return to Game Mode. Go back to Desktop Mode. Open KDE Partition Manager from the Start menu. Identify your new microSD drive and select the partition we cloned onto it. Click \u0026ldquo;Resize/Move\u0026rdquo; and drag the right border of the rectangle to fill up the empty space to the right. Alternatively you can set \u0026ldquo;Free space after\u0026rdquo; to zero. Click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;. (if Partition Manager complains about having the drive mounted, unmount the drive using the command sudo umount /dev/$NEWCARDNAME) Click \u0026ldquo;Apply\u0026rdquo; at the top left. This process should be fairly quick. Now you can safely eject both microSD cards and insert your new, freshly cloned drive in the microSD slot of your Steam Deck. Congratulations, enjoy your perfect clone! All of your applications and games, including emulation should work right out of the box. resizing the partition after rebooting Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to follow me on Twitter. Troubleshooting # Q: I rebooted but I still can\u0026rsquo;t resize my new drive\u0026rsquo;s partition to fill up the empty space, what\u0026rsquo;s happening?\nA: You could try unmounting the drive using\nsudo umount /dev/$NEWCARDNAME (remember: we can figure out the name of the drive using lsblk) and running\nsudo resize2fs /dev/$NEWCARDNAME to try and expand the partition via the Terminal. It might come back with additional instructions, in which case follow those and run it again.\n","date":"13 July 2022","permalink":"/posts/steam-deck-copy-microsd-card-contents-to-larger-drive/","section":"Posts","summary":"Table of contents:","title":"How to mirror / clone Steam Deck microSD to new SD card"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
