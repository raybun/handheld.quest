You buy a 512 GB A2 microSD or even a 1TB card.\nHow can you move / migrate your data from the old SD card to the new one?\nCloning a microSD card in SteamOS (Linux): Prerequisites # What you will need\nSteam Deck old microSD card new microSD card (equal in capacity, or larger) USB-C microSD card reader (or a USB-A card reader and a USB-C adaptor) alternatively: a USB-C dock featuring a SD Card Reader (that\u0026rsquo;s what I used) Handy to have\nexternal Keyboard external Mouse Duration\nIt took me about 45 minutes to clone a 256 GB microSD, then a few minutes for extra setup.\ncloning in progress Steps # Step 1: Format the new card # Remove the OLD card from your Steam Deck after safely ejecting it. Insert the NEW card in the SD card slot. Press the Steam button to enter the menu, go to System -\u0026gt; System Settings -\u0026gt; Format SD Card Once done and it shows up in the Storage menu, you can remove the card from the slot. Now reinsert your OLD card. Step 2: Figure out the names of your devices (drives) in Konsole # Using the Start Menu, launch Konsole (Terminal Emulator).\nNote: if you have not yet set your sudo password, now is the time to set that up. Simply enter the command passwd and hit return. Then configure your password of choice, this will be your superuser/root password for the future, we\u0026rsquo;ll need it in a sec.\nNow we need to determine which drive is which.\nRun the lsblk command to get an overview of your drives and partitions. Take note of the name based on the size of the device, that should help you identify it.\nExample:\nmy OLD microSD is called /mmcblk0 (in SD Slot) my NEW microSD is called /sdb (in card reader dock) Important! Your microSD devices might be called differently, so don\u0026rsquo;t just copy my example. Or you\u0026rsquo;ll have a bad time. Step 3: Run the \u0026ldquo;dd\u0026rdquo; utility for a perfect 1:1 clone # Now we can start cloning.\nImportant! Make sure you have your charger hooked up, as this will take a while! Enter the following command in Konsole:\nsudo dd if=/dev/$OLDCARDNAME of=/dev/$NEWCARDNAME status=progress bs=100M Important! replace $OLDCARDNAME and $NEWCARDNAME (no dollar sign!) with the respective names of the old and new cards. The order matters. What this does: This will clone the drive (and all partitions) specified in if to the drive specified in of, while displaying progress (nice!) and the bs=100M setting will help speed up the process to your microSD\u0026rsquo;s max write speed.\nIt might take a while, up to a couple hours if you\u0026rsquo;re cloning a large drive.\nWhen the process is complete, continue to the next step.\nStep 4: Reboot and resize partition to fill drive # If you are migrating to a larger drive, we need to reboot for the linux kernel to report the correct size for the drive and free space available, so that we can resize the partition to the full extent of the drive. Otherwise it will retain the size of the old drive we cloned. Not useful!\nUsually Linux doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a lot of reboots, but this is one of the cases where you need to restart.\nSimply reboot from the power menu of SteamOS Desktop mode. After reboooting, the Steam Deck will return to Game Mode. Go back to Desktop Mode. Open KDE Partition Manager from the Start menu. Identify your new microSD drive and select the partition we cloned onto it. Click \u0026ldquo;Resize/Move\u0026rdquo; and drag the right border of the rectangle to fill up the empty space to the right. Alternatively you can set \u0026ldquo;Free space after\u0026rdquo; to zero. Click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;. (if Partition Manager complains about having the drive mounted, unmount the drive using the command sudo umount /dev/$NEWCARDNAME) Click \u0026ldquo;Apply\u0026rdquo; at the top left. This process should be fairly quick. Now you can safely eject both microSD cards and insert your new, freshly cloned drive in the microSD slot of your Steam Deck. Congratulations, enjoy your perfect clone! All of your applications and games, including emulation should work right out of the box. Troubleshooting # Q: I rebooted but I still can\u0026rsquo;t resize my new drive\u0026rsquo;s partition to fill up the empty space, what\u0026rsquo;s happening?\nA: You could try unmounting the drive using\nsudo umount /dev/$NEWCARDNAME (remember: we can figure out the name of the drive using lsblk) and running\nsudo resize2fs /dev/$NEWCARDNAME to try and expand the partition via the Terminal. It might come back with additional instructions, in which case follow those and run it again.\n","date":"13 July 2022","permalink":"/posts/steam-deck-copy-microsd-card-contents-to-larger-drive/","section":"Posts","summary":"I bought a larger SD card for my Steam Deck - how to transfer everything?","title":"How to move Steam Deck microSD contents to larger card"},{"content":"","date":"13 July 2022","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
