While the later titles, developed by Eidos Montréal and published by Square Enix, offer refined graphics and gameplay mechanics, they often lack the depth and freedom that made the original game so captivating.\nThe first Deus Ex, on the other hand, set the standard for cyberpunk action RPGs with its rich narrative, intricate level design, and remarkable player choice. Additionally, the later titles seem to have taken a page from Ubisoft\u0026rsquo;s playbook, focusing more on flashy visuals and set pieces rather than maintaining the immersive and thought-provoking experience that the original Deus Ex so expertly delivered. As a result, the original Deus Ex remains a much cooler experience for those who appreciate innovation and substance over superficial flair.\n27.

Then, simply search for \u0026ldquo;Deus Ex: Revision\u0026rdquo; in the Steam store, and download the mod for free.\nThen you can start the game via the Revision entry in your library and enjoy better visuals without having to mess with anything! It\u0026rsquo;s one of the smoothest modding experiences on the Deck.\nConclusion # These top games for Steam Deck offer a diverse range of experiences that are perfect for gaming on the go. Whether you prefer fast-paced action, challenging puzzles, or immersive storylines, there\u0026rsquo;s something for everyone on this list. So, go ahead and give these fantastic titles a try – you won\u0026rsquo;t be disappointed!\n","date":"17 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/best-games-for-steam-deck/","section":"Posts","summary":"The Steam Deck has taken the gaming world by storm, and it\u0026rsquo;s no wonder why.","title":"Best Games for Steam Deck"},{"content":"","date":"17 April 2023","permalink":"/","section":"Documenting my Steam Deck Journey","summary":"","title":"Documenting my Steam Deck Journey"},{"content":"","date":"17 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"Get this SD Card for best speed \u0026amp; reliability on Steam Deck.\nValve\u0026rsquo;s Steam Deck supports microSDXC, which supports up to 2 TB per unit as per the standard. Typically more commercially available however, are cards with up to 1 TB of storage. SD cards are incredibly useful and in terms of actual real-life performance, you won\u0026rsquo;t notice much of a difference compared to the internal storage of the Steam Deck.\nWhat to look for in a microSD card for Steam Deck # V30 (Video Speed Class 30): minimum write speed of 30MB/s U3 (UHS Speed Class 3): minimum write speed of 30MB/s Storage capacity that fits your use case The top microSD recommendation for Steam Deck (as of Q4 2022) # Personally, I prefer the Samsung Evo Select microSD cards for my Steam Deck:\nthey have favourable reviews (5★), great build quality relatively inexpensive at ~$58 at 🛒Amazon.com*, depending upon current offers or ~43€ over at 🛒Amazon.de* Samsung has a great track record in terms of SD card reliability, speed and price/performance ratio.\nI chose the 512 GB variant pictured above, because that\u0026rsquo;s more than I need to store the games and ROMs that I actually play on my 256 GB Steam Deck. Of course the bigger variant of this card is just as great.\nSome people go overboard and store a dozen of these SD cards in a case, in my humble opinion that only results in catalogueing/management overhead, i.e. having to figure out where you stored which game. Additionally, it only really brings analysis paralysis to the table and I find myself actually playing less.\nWhy getting an SD Card for your Steam Deck makes sense # Installing Steam games on microSD expands your storage You can pre-install bigger games for a longer vacation on a secondary or tertiary SD card and carry multiple with you ROMs for Emulators (e.g. EmuDeck and RetroDeck are popular integrated solutions / installers) ideally live on microSD You can reserve the fast internal storage for the games that actually need it (very few have immense load volume) Related posts on the topic of microSD cards on Steam Deck # How to format SD Cards for Steam Deck usage How to migrate your smaller SD card contents to a larger drive ","date":"24 November 2022","permalink":"/posts/best-sd-card-for-steam-deck/","section":"Posts","summary":"Get this SD Card for best speed \u0026amp; reliability on Steam Deck.","title":"Best SD Card for Steam Deck"},{"content":"Where does Steam Deck (SteamOS) store screenshots taken in Game Mode?\nWhy I needed to manually retrieve screenshots from the Deck # When playing with multiple profiles on Steam Deck, there seems to be a bug in the Steam Client preventing screenshot upload for the non-primary users.

Here\u0026rsquo;s my quick review of the Dockteck 7-in-1 USB-C Hub in the context of Steam Deck usage.\nWhy can\u0026rsquo;t the lake have two docks? Because it would be a paradox. Why I chose this dock over other options # had favourable reviews (5★), great build quality it can actually handle 60 Hz refresh rate in practice fits the original Steam Deck case, is portable it won\u0026rsquo;t crush your color values, supports HDR 100W Power Delivery charging (PD 3.0, Fast Role Swap) relatively inexpensive at ~39€ over at 🛒Amazon.de* or ~$41 at 🛒Amazon.com*, depending upon current offers I am not affiliated with Dockteck or any of their partners. Pics or it didn\u0026rsquo;t happen # Case in point. The dock fits perfectly in the little pouch at the bottom of the bag. All ports on one side. Ethernet at the tail end. Everything has a snug fit. Small and sleek. Will definitely use it with my laptop as well. First impressions and quick tests # The dock will let the Steam Deck output at the full 4K resolution with 60 Hz, as confirmed via display properties. Accessible in SteamOS Desktop mode via:\nSystem Settings 🡺 Display and Monitor 🡺 Display Configuration.\nMake sure the right display is selected when checking. I prefer having the Steam Dock positioned below the TV in vertical space, feels a bit more intuitive when moving about in Desktop mode.\nNot all USB-C HDMI adapters and docks will perform at 60hz, some claim to do so but don\u0026rsquo;t deliver, many others are 30hz spec.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a common issue with USB-C 🡺 HDMI adapters, at 30 Hz you\u0026rsquo;ll get 30 FPS tops, which will feel particularly sluggish in the menu UI and obviously isn\u0026rsquo;t great for gaming. I went down that rabbit hole before, trying to find a decent hub to allow me to work from my M1 Mac, using a TV as my 4K monitor.\nI hooked up my power brick and voila, charging at full speed. Note that the Steam Deck will, at least at the current state, request 15 Volts from the dock. This means that it will get a maximum of 45 Watts and some of that will be reserved to power other potential peripherals. According to the specs, this dock will reserve up to 8 Watts.\nIn my tests so far, the Deck charges quickly (and without a slow charging error) with my 65W Anker Atom power plug (I like charging my phone on the power plug\u0026rsquo;s secondary port). Other devices negotiating the full 20 Volts (e.g. modern laptops) will benefit from the full 100W charging power.\nMy own FREE DEMO for Steam Deck: Does the Steam Deck have a \u0026ldquo;Docked Mode\u0026rdquo;? # Sidenote: The Steam Deck treats HDMI output as pretty much the same thing as playing in handheld mode, it\u0026rsquo;s not like the Nintendo Switch. The latter boosts clock frequencies when docked, this does not. You can expect pretty much the same performance as in handheld mode, just on a bigger screen.\ngraph LR; A[Steam Deck]--\u003eB[Dockteck USB-C Hub]; B--\u003eC[4K TV display / monitor] At the time of publishing this article, the Steam Deck outputs the external monitor\u0026rsquo;s native resolution per default, but will maintain the rendering resolution of your games. You can then use FSR (or one of the other scaling methods) to handle upscaling. FSR has the benefit of usually looking a bit sharper.\nDoes the dock work well? # Games look and feel great, I was even able to still use the Steam Deck as my controller (I like the trackpads!) and rest it on my lap, along with the dock and a longer HDMI cable. Having all of the input features of the Deck available is my personal preference and what makes the device so great imho, but you can just as well hook up any compatible wireless controller (I have a DualShock 4, apparently Xbox controllers have a latency issue) over Bluetooth and use the Deck as a linux console.\nThe dock does get warm (not hot to the touch) during usage. Nothing to worry about, the metal enclosure does a good job regarding heat distribution. All of these USB-C hubs get significantly warmer than your usual USB-Hub from years ago, but it\u0026rsquo;s completely within reason. I willy-nilly plugged in the PD input as well as Ethernet, unplugged and replugged everything while idling at the home screen and within games - no issues so far.\nI\u0026rsquo;m completely happy with the performance of the Dockteck hub/dock and would recommend it if you\u0026rsquo;re still on the fence about buying a dock. I particularly like the solid build quality, thermal conduction of the enclosure, nicely wrapped and reinforced cable (not too stiff), portability and so far it has just worked.\nWhere to buy? # 🛒Amazon.com (USA)* 🛒Amazon.de (Germany and friends)* *Affiliate link.

By the way, in case you\u0026rsquo;re still looking for the right card to buy: here\u0026rsquo;s my personal recommendation - The ideal Steam Deck SD Card for the fastest load times.\nHow can you move / migrate your data from the old SD card to the new one?\nOption 1: Using the Dolphin GUI file manager # You can just copy and paste your respective folders using Dolphin (the Explorer equivalent of SteamOS) and that will work unless you have some weird setup - but that is painfully slow if your microSD is loaded with lots of data\u0026hellip; which is likely if you\u0026rsquo;re migrating to a larger disk.\nOption 2: Using rsync # I like command-line utilities and don\u0026rsquo;t quite trust GUI file managers for large data migrations. One kind reddit user suggested using rsync and provided a mini guide. I have found it to be too slow as well, in a quick test. If your disk is quite full or you have a lot of tiny files (likely!), use the guide below.\nOption 3: this guide, using dd to clone # This will max out the write speed of your microSD drive and provide the fastest result. It involves using the Terminal, but hey, you\u0026rsquo;re here to learn, right? This will teach you useful Linux-fu.\nMy own FREE DEMO for Steam Deck: How to clone a whole drive in linux using the dd utility (e.g. for creating a perfect clone of your microSD on Steam Deck) # What you will need\nSteam Deck old microSD card new microSD card (equal in capacity, or larger) USB-C microSD card reader (or a USB-A card reader and a USB-C adapter) alternatively: a USB-C dock featuring a SD Card Reader (that\u0026rsquo;s what I used) Handy to have, not required\nexternal Keyboard external Mouse Duration\nIt took me about 45 minutes to clone a 256 GB microSD to a new 512 GB drive I bought at a sale, then a few minutes for extra setup.\ncloning in progress Guide (start here): Clone your Steam Deck microSD in 3 easy steps! # Step 1: Figure out the names of your devices (drives) in Konsole # Using the Start Menu, launch Konsole (Terminal Emulator).\nNote: if you have not yet set your sudo password, now is the time to set that up. Simply enter the command passwd and hit return. Then configure your password of choice, this will be your superuser/root password for the future, we\u0026rsquo;ll need it in a sec.\nNow we need to determine which drive is which.\nRun the lsblk command to get an overview of your drives and partitions. Take note of the name based on the size of the device, that should help you identify it.\nExample:\nmy OLD microSD is called /mmcblk0 (in SD Slot) my NEW microSD is called /sdb (in card reader dock) Important! Your microSD devices might be called differently, so don\u0026rsquo;t just copy my example. Or you\u0026rsquo;ll have a bad time. Step 2: Run the \u0026ldquo;dd\u0026rdquo; utility for a perfect 1:1 clone # Now we can start cloning.\nImportant! Make sure you have your charger hooked up, as this will take a while! Enter the following command in Konsole:\nsudo dd if=/dev/$OLDCARDNAME of=/dev/$NEWCARDNAME status=progress bs=100M Important! replace $OLDCARDNAME and $NEWCARDNAME (no dollar sign!) with the respective names of the old and new cards. The order matters. What this does: This will clone the drive (and all partitions) specified in if to the drive specified in of, while displaying progress (nice!) and the bs=100M setting will help speed up the process to your microSD\u0026rsquo;s max write speed by adjusting the block size.\nIt might take a while, up to a couple hours if you\u0026rsquo;re cloning a large drive.\nWhen the process is complete, continue to the next step.\nmy microSD write speed is maxed out Step 3: Reboot and resize partition to fill drive # If you are migrating to a larger drive, we need to reboot for the linux kernel to report the correct size for the drive and free space available, so that we can resize the partition to the full extent of the drive. Otherwise it will retain the size of the old drive we cloned. Not useful!\nUsually Linux doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a lot of reboots, but this is one of the cases where you need to restart.\nSimply reboot from the power menu of SteamOS Desktop mode. After reboooting, the Steam Deck will return to Game Mode. Go back to Desktop Mode. Open KDE Partition Manager from the Start menu. Identify your new microSD drive and select the partition we cloned onto it. Click \u0026ldquo;Resize/Move\u0026rdquo; and drag the right border of the rectangle to fill up the empty space to the right. Alternatively you can set \u0026ldquo;Free space after\u0026rdquo; to zero. Click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;. (if Partition Manager complains about having the drive mounted, unmount the drive using the command sudo umount /dev/$NEWCARDNAME) Click \u0026ldquo;Apply\u0026rdquo; at the top left. This process should be fairly quick. Now you can safely eject both microSD cards and insert your new, freshly cloned drive in the microSD slot of your Steam Deck. Congratulations, enjoy your perfect clone! All of your applications and games, including emulation should work right out of the box. resizing the partition after rebooting Troubleshooting # Q: I rebooted but I still can\u0026rsquo;t resize my new drive\u0026rsquo;s partition to fill up the empty space, what\u0026rsquo;s happening?\nA: You could try unmounting the drive using\nsudo umount /dev/$NEWCARDNAME (remember: we can figure out the name of the drive using lsblk) and running\nsudo resize2fs /dev/$NEWCARDNAME to try and expand the partition via the Terminal. It might come back with additional instructions, in which case follow those and run it again.\n","date":"13 July 2022","permalink":"/posts/steam-deck-copy-microsd-card-contents-to-larger-drive/","section":"Posts","summary":"A guide on migrating a whole partition or drive in SteamOS or Linux in general.","title":"How to Mirror / Clone Steam Deck microSD to New SD Card"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
