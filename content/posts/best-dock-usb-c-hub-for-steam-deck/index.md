This dock just works, provides ample power for charging and supports 60 Hz at 4K resolution. Here's my quick review of the Dockteck 7-in-1 USB-C Hub in the context of Steam Deck usage.

Why can't the lake have two docks?
*Because it would be a paradox.*

## Why I chose this dock over other options

- had favourable reviews (5â˜…), great build quality
- it can actually handle **60 Hz refresh rate** in practice
- fits the original Steam Deck case, is **portable**
- it won't crush your color values, supports HDR
- **100W Power Delivery charging** (PD 3.0, Fast Role Swap) 
- relatively inexpensive at ~39â‚¬ over at ðŸ›’[Amazon.de*](https://amzn.to/3vk6gZ0)
- or ~$41 at ðŸ›’[Amazon.com*](https://amzn.to/3owqs64), depending upon current offers

## First impressions and quick tests

The dock will let the Steam Deck output at the full 4K resolution with 60hz, as confirmed via display properties. Accessible in SteamOS Desktop mode via:

System Settings&nbsp;ðŸ¡º&nbsp;Display and Monitor&nbsp;ðŸ¡º&nbsp;Display Configuration.

Make sure the right display is selected when checking. I prefer having the Steam Dock positioned below the TV in vertical space, feels a bit more intuitive when moving about in Desktop mode.

Not all USB-C HDMI adapters and docks will perform at 60hz, some claim to do so but don't deliver, many others are 30hz spec.

It's a common issue with USB-C&nbsp;ðŸ¡º&nbsp;HDMI&nbsp;adapters, at 30&nbsp;Hz you'll get 30&nbsp;FPS tops, which will feel particularly sluggish in the menu UI and obviously isn't great for gaming. I went down that rabbit hole before, trying to find a decent hub to allow me to work from my M1&nbsp;Mac, using a TV as my 4K&nbsp;monitor.

I hooked up my power brick and voila, charging at full speed.



## Does the Steam Deck have a "Docked Mode"?

**Sidenote:** The Steam Deck treats HDMI output as pretty much the same thing as playing in handheld mode, it's not like the Nintendo Switch. The latter boosts clock frequencies when docked, this does not. You can expect pretty much the same performance as in handheld mode, just on a bigger screen.

At the time of publishing this article, the Steam Deck outputs the external monitor's native resolution per default, but will maintain the rendering resolution of your games. You can then use FSR (or one of the other scaling methods) to handle upscaling. FSR has the benefit of usually looking a bit sharper.

## Does the dock work well?

Games look and feel great, I was even able to still use the Steam Deck as my controller (I like the trackpads!) and rest it on my lap, along with the dock and a longer HDMI cable. Having all of the input features of the Deck available is my personal preference and what makes the device so great imho, but you can just as well hook up any compatible wireless controller (I have a DualShock 4, apparently Xbox controllers have a latency issue) over Bluetooth and use the Deck as a linux console.

The dock does get *warm* (not hot to the touch) during usage. Nothing to worry about, the metal enclosure does a good job regarding heat distribution. All of these USB-C hubs get significantly warmer than your usual USB-Hub from years ago, but it's completely within reason. I willy-nilly plugged in the PD input as well as Ethernet, unplugged and replugged everything while idling at the home screen and within games - no issues so far.

I'm completely happy with the performance of the Dockteck hub/dock and would recommend it if you're still on the fence about buying a dock. I particularly like the solid build quality, thermal conduction of the enclosure, nicely wrapped and reinforced cable (not too stiff), portability and so far it has *just worked*.
