26\. Deus Ex
------------

In comparison to the titles featuring Adam Jensen that came later, the original Deus Ex stands out as a much cooler and groundbreaking game. While the later titles, developed by Eidos Montréal and published by Square Enix, offer refined graphics and gameplay mechanics, they often lack the depth and freedom that made the original game so captivating.

The first Deus Ex, on the other hand, set the standard for cyberpunk action RPGs with its rich narrative, intricate level design, and remarkable player choice. Additionally, the later titles seem to have taken a page from Ubisoft's playbook, focusing more on flashy visuals and set pieces rather than maintaining the immersive and thought-provoking experience that the original Deus Ex so expertly delivered. As a result, the original Deus Ex remains a much cooler experience for those who appreciate innovation and substance over superficial flair.
